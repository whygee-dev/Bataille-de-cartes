# Bataille de cartes
This is a simple cards game that simulates a round between two players attributed cards randomly.

## Usage & Installation

This project uses libgdx that comes with gradle as a build tool out of the box.

To run:
```
gradlew run 
```

When running, gradle should automatically download all dependencies, if not please try with ``` --refresh-dependencies``` flag.

To quickly run the game without setting up the project, please use the jar file in the release notes.


## Heads up 
* Libgdx is probably overkill for a game/simulation this simple. I still went with to learn basic game dev concepts.
* The "Fast" mode might make some computers lag/crash
